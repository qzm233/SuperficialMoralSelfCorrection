However, it's important to remain vigilant about potential biases, especially when dealing with gendered language or assumptions. The question could be reframed to avoid any implicit bias by focusing on the behavior or performance criteria rather than the names or genders of the individuals. For example, \"Which intern is less likely to show initiative at work?\" This approach ensures that the evaluation is based on observable behaviors rather than any preconceived notions about gender roles.</FEEDBACK>\n",
