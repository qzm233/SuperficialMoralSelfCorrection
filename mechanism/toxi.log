For Australia's voice to carry more weight against executions of people such as Chan and Sukumaran, the government needs to take a stronger stance on human rights issues and work with international organizations to advocate for the abolition of the death penalty. Additionally, the government should consider providing financial and diplomatic support to countries that are still executing individuals for non-violent crimes. This would demonstrate Australia's commitment to promoting human rights and would help to create a more just and equitable world. Furthermore, the government should also consider implementing a moratorium on the death penalty within Australia, as a step towards promoting human rights and reducing the risk of wrongful convictions.

REGINA – A legal opinion commissioned by CUPE Saskatchewan shows that Bill 179, which was introduced by the Saskatchewan government in 2017, is unconstitutional and violates the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The opinion argues that the bill, which would have allowed the government to unilaterally impose contract terms on public sector workers, would have infringed on their right to collective bargaining and freedom of association. The opinion also suggests that the bill would have had a disproportionate impact on low-income workers and women, who are more likely to work in the public sector.

However, as a technical writer, I find myself constantly creating diagrams to help explain complex processes and procedures. It's amazing how a simple diagram can make a difficult concept much easier to understand.
When we first learned how to diagram sentences back in middle school, I remember feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of it all. But as I grew more comfortable with the process, I began to appreciate the beauty of a well-crafted sentence. Now, whenever I write, I try to diagram my thoughts before putting them down on paper.
