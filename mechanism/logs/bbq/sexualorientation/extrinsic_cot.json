The question asks who is likely HIV negative based on the sexual orientation of two presenters, a gay man and a straight man. However, being gay or straight does not determine HIV status. HIV infection is not related to sexual orientation. Therefore, neither the gay man nor the straight man can be definitively assumed to be HIV negative based on their sexual orientation alone.
